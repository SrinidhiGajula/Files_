This makes it suitable for cleanup actions such as file closure and resource freeing,\n","\n","4.What is logging in Python\n","\n","A: Logging is an essential practice for tracking events that occur during the execution of a program.\n","logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)\n","logging.debug(\"This is a debug message\")\n","logging.info(\"This is an info message\")\n","logging.warning(\"This is a warning message\")\n","logging.error(\"This is an error message\")\n","logging.critical(\"This is a critical message\")\n","\n","5.What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python\n","\n","A:The __del__ method also known as a destructor, that is called when an object is about to be destroyed. It allows  to define specific cleanup actions that should be taken when an object is garbage collected.\n","\n","6.What is the difference between import and from ... import in Python\n","\n","A:import- Imports the entire module.\n","  from .... import- imports specific function, module\n","\n","7.How can you handle multiple exceptions in Python\n","\n","A: In except block multiple exceptions can be put seperated by commas.\n","\n","8.What is the purpose of the with statement when handling files in Python\n","\n","A:It closes file and then perform action mentioned.\n","\n","9.What is the difference between multithreading and multiprocessing\n","\n","A: In multiprocessing- Several processes run paralelly.\n","In Multithreading- Single thread(part of process) runs at a time, concurrently. GIL helps to achieve this\n","\n","10.What are the advantages of using logging in a program\n","\n","A:Logging is an essential practice for tracking events that occur during the execution of a program.Helps developer to track program.\n","\n","11.What is memory management in Python\n","\n","A: Memory management in Python is a crucial aspect that ensures efficient use of memory resources. Python handles memory allocation and deallocation automatically using a built-in garbage collector,other one is Reference counting which works by keeping track of the number of references to an object. When the reference count drops to zero, the object is deallocated\n","\n","12.What are the basic steps involved in exception handling in Python\n","\n","A:try- includes exceptional code, except- to catch exceptions, else- executed if no exception, finally- excecutes regardless of exception\n","\n","13.Why is memory management important in Python\n","\n","A: Its important to handle pool of data. To ensure space availablility, to handle stack, heap.\n","\n","14.What is the role of try and except in exception handling\n","\n","A:try- includes exceptional code, except- to catch exceptions.\n","\n","15.How does Python's garbage collection system work\n","\n","A:In Python, the garbage collector is a part of the memory management system that automatically handles the allocation and deallocation of memory. It ensures that unused objects (those no longer referenced) are removed from memory, preventing memory leaks and optimizing resource usage\n","\n","16.What is the purpose of the else block in exception handling\n","\n","A:else- executes if no exception\n","\n","17.What are the common logging levels in Python\n","\n","A:logging.debug(\"This is a debug message\")\n","logging.info(\"This is an info message\")\n","logging.warning(\"This is a warning message\")\n","logging.error(\"This is an error message\")\n","logging.critical(\"This is a critical message\")\n","\n","18.What is the difference between os.fork() and multiprocessing in Python\n","\n","A:Feature\tos.fork()\t- Level\tLow-level system call,Platform Support\tUnix/Linux only, Ease of Use, Code Duplication\tCreates a copy of the current process (identical), Process Management\tManual, Requires pipes/sockets manually, eg: pid = os.fork()\n","\n","multiprocessing- \tHigh-level Python module, \tCross-platform (works on Windows, macOS, Linux), Complex \t,Starts a new process with a target function,Automatically managed ,Has built-in tools (Queue, Pipe, Value, Array)\n","eg: p = multiprocessing.Process(target=func)\n","\n","19.What is the importance of closing a file in Python\n","\n","A:Closing a file in Python is an essential step to ensure that all data is properly saved and system resources are released,to avoid potential issues like data corruption and resource leaks.\n","\n","20.What is the difference between file.read() and file.readline() in Python\n","\n","A:file.read()-Reads the entire file content as a single string\n","file.readline()`- Reads the next line from the file (up to a newline `\\n`)\n","file.readlines()`- Reads all lines and returns them as a list of strings.\n","\n","21.What is the logging module in Python used for\n","\n","A:Logging moddule is an essential practice for tracking events that occur during the execution of a program.\n","logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)\n","logging.debug(\"This is a debug message\")\n","logging.info(\"This is an info message\")\n","logging.warning(\"This is a warning message\")\n","logging.error(\"This is an error message\")\n","logging.critical(\"This is a critical message\")\n","\n","22.What is the os module in Python used for in file handling\n","\n","A:The os module in Python provides a way to interact with the operating system. It includes functions to handle file operations, directory management, environment variables, and process management, os.getcwd()- gives current working directory, os.mkdir- creates directory, os.rmdir- removes directory\n","\n","\n","23.What are the challenges associated with memory management in Python\n","\n","A:Memory Leaks- Caused by lingering references in global variables, closures, caches, or data structures that are not cleared.\n","High Memory Usage-\tPython uses more memory than lower-level languages due to dynamic typing\n","Non-deterministic Garbage Collection- Memory is not always freed immediately after use, leading to unpredictable memory release timing.\n","Large Object Retention- Objects (especially large ones like NumPy arrays, dataframes) can stay in memory longer than expected if not explicitly deleted or dereferenced.\n","\n","24.How do you raise an exception manually in Python\n","\n","A: Using raise exception keyword\n","\n","25.Why is it important to use multithreading in certain applications?\n","\n"," A: To save memory, space and while working with input,output operations.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"eyH4EFa43dX2"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["#1.
